Welcome to my repository! I intend to compile and summarise a variety of 3D Printing related things. It will primarily revolve around FDM and DLP. If you have any suggestions or additions, feel free to message me!

# Hardware

  ## 3D Printers
  
   ### FDM
   
   #### Open Source
   - [Voron](https://vorondesign.com/) - Voron is a line of DIY, no-compromise 3D Printers. You need to source and print the parts yourself.
      -[Voron 0.1](https://vorondesign.com/voron0.1) - The smallet of the lineup, it's a traditional CoreXY with a full enclosure and a 120mm^3 bed. You can fit all Trident/V2.4 parts on it. The price estimate is about 400-600 USD and some kits in that price range are available. 
      - [Voron Trident](https://vorondesign.com/voron_trident)
      - [Voron 2.4](https://vorondesign.com/voron2.4) - The Voron V2 is is a modified CoreXY with a static bed and a three axis moving gantry. The linear rails make the print size scalable, from 250mm^3 to 350mm^3. Its estimated cost is between 1500 to 1900 USD.
      - [Voron Switchwire](https://vorondesign.com/voron_switchwire) - Voron's take on a standard Cartesian design, with a bed size of 250Ã—210. The estimated cost is between 700-900 USD
      - [Voron Legacy](https://vorondesign.com/voron_legacy) - A more classic CoreXY design using rods instead of rails, the bed size is 230mm^3 and the estimated price is 600-800 USD.
   - [EVA](https://eva-3d.github.io/eva-spec/)
   - [White Knight](https://github.com/NAK3DDesigns/White-Knight) - White Knight is a 45 degree belt printer.
   - [SnakeOil XY](https://github.com/SnakeOilXY/SnakeOil-XY) - SnakeOil is an affordable, small CoreXY printer.
   - [HevORT](http://docs.hevort.com/#%2Fpages%2Fhome=) - A big CoreXY printer with a self levelling 3 point bed.
   - [Annex Engineering](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering) - A line of open source CoreXY printers that utilise a very unique motion system.
      - [Masherbrum K1](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Masherbrum-K1) - The K1 is a Medium, Direct Drive, fully enclosed 3D printer. It uses an unconventional XY motion system inspired by the "Hypercube Overkill Project". The build volume can be between 200mm^3 to 500mm^3 and the Z axis can theoretically be up to 1 metre tall. The gantry moves while the bed is stationary.
      - [Chhogori K2](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Chhogori-K2) - Very similar to the K1 but with a minimum build volume of 250^3 (still up to 500^3) but with a moving bed and a fixed gantry. 
      - [Gasherbrum K3](https://github.com/Annex-Engineering/Gasherbrum-K3) - The K3 is incredibly similar to the K2 but smaller and more compact. The build volume is 180^3.


   ### DLP

  ## Add-ons and Mods
  
  - [Official GitHub Repo](https://github.com/VoronDesign/VoronUsers/tree/master/printer_mods)/[Voronmods](https://faked.org/voronmods/)/[TeamFDM](https://www.teamfdm.com/files/category/2-printable-voron-user-mods/#:~:text=Voron%20User%20Mods%2C%20or%20%22UserMods,0%20Licensing.) - Sites and repositories containing mods and add-ons for the Voron lineup of printers.
  - [EVA](https://eva-3d.github.io/eva-spec/) - EVA is a modular front for 3D printer parts that aims to allow easy swapping of parts for testing and experimentation.
  - [Voron to EVA](https://github.com/majarspeed/Voron-EVA-conversion) This is a conversion mod that converts a Voron printer to be EVA compatible.
  
   ### Multi-Material
   - [Enraged Rabbit Project](https://github.com/EtteGit/EnragedRabbitProject) - A multi-material filament switcher for Direct Drive toolheads and printers running Klippr. Primarily made for the Voron printers but it is compatible with any printers that fit the above requirements.
   - [SMuFF](https://sites.google.com/view/the-smuff/) or [SMuFF on GitHub](https://github.com/technik-gegg/SMuFF-1.1) - SMuFF or Smart Multi Filament Feeder is a scalable multimaterial filament loader. It most commonly replaces a bowden setup and it runs on its own control board connected via a UART serial port.
      - [OctoPrint SMuFF](https://github.com/technik-gegg/OctoPrint-Smuff) - An OctoPrint plugin that handles SMuFF.
  
  ## Parts
  
  ## Miscellaneous
  - [FreeLoader](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/freeloader.html) - An OpenSource material testing rig, it can apply tensile and compression loads.
  
  - [Prusa i3 Parts](https://github.com/prusa3d/Original-Prusa-i3) - STL Files for the printed parts of the Prusa i3.
